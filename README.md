# 🌿 SoulScape – A VR-Based Mental Wellness Application

## 📖 Introduction

In a world that's constantly moving, taking time to slow down and care for our mental well-being has become more important than ever.  
**SoulScape** is a VR-based mental wellness experience designed to help users relax, refocus, and find emotional balance through immersive environments and guided audio.  

Developed as part of our **mini project** at **Government Engineering College Kozhikode**, SoulScape explores how technology—specifically Virtual Reality—can be used to support mindfulness, calm, and mental clarity.  
This application blends technical skills with a human-centered approach to create a space where users can simply pause, breathe, and feel better.
